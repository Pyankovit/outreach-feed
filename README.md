Activity Feed
- Create an Activity Feed app per the designs:

Features
- A note input field that allows for plaintext input
- The notes have the following properties
- Timestamp
- User that created it
- Type (Message/Phone/Coffee/Beer/Meeting Note)
- There should be an activity feed that lists all of the notes in chronological order
- It should display:
- User that wrote the note
- Relative Timestamp
The note
- It should have the following actions:
Delete
- A good project is sufficiently covered by unit tests

Implementation notes
- Write regular code with everything you would use at work
- Expected duration is 50 mins - 2 hours

The current user (You) and the contact (Milton Romaguera) can be passed as properties that are hardcoded at the upper layer
- Do not write any backend, store data as a local state
- Focus more on code structure rather than being pixel perfect
- Use TypeScript and React.
- Anything that can be found on npmjs.com is allowed
